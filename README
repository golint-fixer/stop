This is not the package that you are looking for. This package is
solely for my own amusement. Instead, you should be looking at the gc
or gccgo compilers. If you just want compiler pieces, you should use
the wonderful lexer, parser, type checker, and static single
assignment packages in the Go standard library and go.exp
repositories. Those packages are battle tested and probably more
efficient and better designed than this one. Use them.
